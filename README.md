Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For Project Two I was working as an AI developer for a gaming company. The company is developing a treasure hunt game where the player needs to find the treasure before the pirates find it. As an AI developer, I have been asked to design an intelligent agent of the game for an NPC (non-player character) to represent the pirate. I was given starter code with a sample environment where your pirate agent will be placed and was then asked to develop code for the Q-Training algorithm section. Here the objective was to complete the program for the intelligent agent so that it achieves its goal of the pirate finding the treasure. 

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
 
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists are asked to analyze, design, and develop hardware and software that is used to solve real world problems.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist I like to first understand the problem that is being asked of me before I directly jump into and try and solve the problem. I then like to design a solution around how I can go about solving the problem. From here I will investigate implementing the solution that I have found and then finally, I would check to see if my solution solved the problem.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization is to ensure that everyone is being treated fairly and practical ethical behavior such as competitive pay, ensuring all employes receive the same treatment, and ensuring all work materials are ethically sourced.
